Coursera research response

##Response to a research quiz on Coursera Data Science - Johns Hopkins - Specialisation

There is a significant difference from the median income for college graduates for a select few major categories. There is a strongly positive relationship for business majors (p<0.01) and a positive relationship for Engineering, Biology & Agriculture majors (p < 0.05). No significant difference was seen for other categories. Any dependence on gender or employment levels was not examined in this quick study.
